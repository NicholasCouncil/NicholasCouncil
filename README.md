# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### This Repo is all about me!
I am currently a Full time student at Western Michigan University.
My major is in **Cybersecurity** and a minor in **Business Analytics**.

The entire field of Cybersecurity is intruiging to me, however, topic I am most interested in is Cryptology.

### Personal Life
Most of my personal life has to do with spending time with my wife and dog, as well as, taking care of our farm.
